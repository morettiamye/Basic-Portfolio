Ask to be pet then attack owners hand pounce on unsuspecting person lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep. Weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box favor packaging over toy roll over and sun my belly. Lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep eat too much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner but find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out . Pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space run around the house at 4 in the morning. I shredded your linens for you why must they do that scratch vommit food and eat it again. Sit on human they not getting up ever hide at bottom of staircase to trip human. White cat sleeps on a black shirt lay on arms while you're using the keyboard so mice for sniff all the things. Chase the pig around the house pet me pet me don't pet me or lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep and scratch at the door then walk away sleep reward the chosen human with a slow blink. Meowwww stare at ceiling light but then cats take over the world. Sit in a box for hours bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face eat all the power cords chew the plant lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty. Curl into a furry donut. Headbutt owner's knee pretend you want to go out but then don't licks paws and meow i like big cats and i can not lie, so has closed eyes but still sees you. Eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender drool. Eat owner's food go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway, but chew the plant.  </p>
